# cd-collection
Basic web app to learn some Angular, ScalaJS and Http4s. Uses Scala, Sqlest and H2 db for backend.

#To-do
- Re-write JS with ScalaJS (and re-factor!)

- Album page

- Generator page

- Figure out how all the Angular dependencies work - do I need to check them into my repo or can I get SBT to handle it?

- Handle service errors in the UI

- Formatting of the edit/add windows (clearable, mandatory, sizing)

- Table column widths - keep them fixed width somehow?

- Add all the parent artist logic and functionality inc domain validation for artists to only allow one level of parenthood

- Artist delete

- Ship master copy with empty DB

#To run

From SBT:

~re-start 

to fire up server, then go to localhost:8080
